# Custom PostgreSQL configuration for bulk data imports
# This file will be included in the main postgresql.conf

# Increase max_wal_size for faster bulk imports (reduces checkpoint frequency)
max_wal_size = 2GB

# Also increase min_wal_size for consistency
min_wal_size = 1GB

# Increase checkpoint_timeout to reduce checkpoint frequency during large imports
checkpoint_timeout = 30min

# Increase maintenance_work_mem for faster index creation and COPY operations
maintenance_work_mem = 512MB

# Increase shared_buffers for better performance (if you have enough RAM)
shared_buffers = 256MB

# Disable synchronous_commit during bulk loads for faster writes (less durable but faster)
# synchronous_commit = off  # Uncomment this line if you want even faster imports (less safe)
